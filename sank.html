This festival is observed largely in Odisha by both Arya and Anarya i.e, ,Keonjhar and Sundargarh where the tribal population is more than forty per cent, the festival is celebrated with great joy and merriment.Moreover, the time of the festival is best suited for them as all agricultural operations are over by that time and each family possess something after the harvest. Liquor is freely consumed by men and women. They sing and dance and enjoy life for about a week. Young girls of certain communities mostly Kudumi, Bastiti, Rajual etc. worship  ‘Tushu’, a female deity and immerse it in the river or tank singing songs of a special variety.</p></font><BR>
